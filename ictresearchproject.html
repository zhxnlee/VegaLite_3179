         Obesity is a complex disease involving an excessive amount of body fat. 
        Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. 
         It is a medical problem that increases your risk of other diseases and health problems, such as heart disease,
         diabetes, high blood pressure and certain cancers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            According to Carbone et.al (2019), Obesity is directly proportional to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. (Heart failure and Coronary Heart Disease in particular). This is because the pro-inflammatory cytokines which is produced by the adipose tissue can induce cardiac dysfunction and thus promoting the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.

           <b>Hypothesis:</b> Obese people tend to be more prone to Heart Diseases compared to others because obese people do not plan their diet properly
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Explanation:</b> The hypothesis was created to investigate the relationship between the estimated number of people in Australia with different type of Heart Diseases and the Body Weight Index (BMI). The type of Heart Diseases analysed are Heart Stroke and Hypertention. The type of Body Weight Index (BMI) are divided into Underweight, Normal, Overweight and Obese. As the Body Weight Index (BMI) increases, the estimated number of people in Australia with these Heart Diseases also increases. This is because obese people did not plan their diet properly, thus leading to obesity and Heart Diseases. Consequently, if the Body Weight Index (BMI) decreases, the estimated number of people in Australia with Heart Diseases also decreases.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Importance:</b> The hypothesis is created is used to prove that the Body Weight Index (BMI) will have an impact on the estimated number of people with Heart Diseases in Australia. Therefore, it is crucial for the citizens in Australia to have a proper diet plan and exercise regularly to prevent these Heart Diseases. This is so that they can improve their Health physically and mentally. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Outcomes:</b> The estimated number of people in Australia with Health Conditions were collected from searching online from the website Australian Burneau Statistics. The data was then compared and cleaned by narrowing the Health Conditions mainly on Heart Diseases and Obesity. The data collected was from year 2017 - 2018.

            According to the "University of Michigan" (n.d.), the elevated number of triglycerides are an important risk factor for Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD) which can cause Heart Stroke/Heart Attack.

        <br>
        <p>Meat and Butter contains these triglycerides which can cause both Obesity and Heart Stroke.</p>

                        In conclusion, the analysis and observation concluded that the hypothesis is supported based on the data gathered. According to the 3 variables, the Body Weight Index (BMI) has effected both the estimated number of people in Australia and the Type of Heart Diseases. From all the Analysis, it can be seen that the estimated number of people with different Heart Diseases such as Heart Stroke, Hypertension has increased as the Body Weight Index (BMI) of the people increases. This is mainly because the people in Australia with Obesity did not plan their diet properly, causing them to have these Heart Diseases.
